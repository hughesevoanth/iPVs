\title{A function to identify the Principal Variable of a group}
\usage{
Kcluster_PVs(cmat, Kmembers, myPVs)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmat}{a correlation matrix you can pass to the function, which will skip the generation of a new matrix.}

\item{Kmembers}{a list, where each object in the list is a vector of variable IDs, identifying the members of a cluster or group.}

\item{myPVs}{a vector of my Principal Variable (myPVs) for each cluster}
}
